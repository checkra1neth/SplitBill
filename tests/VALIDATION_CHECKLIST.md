## Manual Verification Steps

While automated tests cover the logic, manual verification is recommended for:

### 1. Bill Creation Flow (Manual)
- [ ] Connect wallet to Base Sepolia
- [ ] Create bill with escrow enabled
- [ ] Verify transaction appears in wallet
- [ ] Check transaction on BaseScan
- [ ] Verify bill stored with correct metadata

### 2. Payment Flow (Manual)
- [ ] Open escrow bill as participant
- [ ] Click "Pay via Escrow" button
- [ ] Confirm transaction in wallet
- [ ] Verify payment status updates
- [ ] Check all participants paid
- [ ] Verify settlement occurs

### 3. Error Scenarios (Manual)
- [ ] Try paying with wrong amount
- [ ] Try paying twice
- [ ] Try paying from non-participant wallet
- [ ] Try with insufficient balance
- [ ] Try on wrong network
- [ ] Verify error messages are clear

### 4. Backward Compatibility (Manual)
- [ ] Load old bill (if available)
- [ ] Create new direct payment bill
- [ ] Create new escrow bill
- [ ] Verify all display correctly
- [ ] Verify no escrow UI for direct bills

### Recommendations

1. **Manual Testing:** Perform manual testing on Base Sepolia testnet with real wallets
2. **E2E Tests:** Consider adding end-to-end tests with Playwright/Cypress
3. **Performance Testing:** Measure actual gas costs on testnet
4. **Security Audit:** Conduct professional audit before mainnet deployment
5. **User Acceptance Testing:** Have real users test the feature
