- **Hooks:** Tested through integration tests
- **Error Paths:** Comprehensive error scenario coverage

### Test Characteristics
- **Fast:** All tests complete in ~1.5 seconds
- **Isolated:** Each test is independent
- **Deterministic:** No flaky tests
- **Maintainable:** Clear structure and naming

### Best Practices Applied
- ✓ AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

## Integration Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete Escrow Bill Flow
**Steps:**
1. Create bill with escrow enabled
2. Generate escrowBillId
3. Store bill with metadata
4. Retrieve and validate bill

**Result:** ✅ All steps pass

### Scenario 2: Multi-Participant Payment
**Steps:**
1. Create bill with 3 participants
2. Calculate shares for each
3. Track payment status
4. Detect settlement readiness

**Result:** ✅ All steps pass

### Scenario 3: Error Recovery
**Steps:**
1. Attempt payment with wrong amount
2. Receive error message
3. Retry with correct amount
4. Verify success

**Result:** ✅ All steps pass

### Scenario 4: Backward Compatibility
**Steps:**
1. Load old bill (no escrow fields)
2. Create new direct bill
3. Create new escrow bill
4. Verify all work correctly

**Result:** ✅ All steps pass

## Known Limitations

### What's NOT Tested
1. **Real Blockchain Interactions:** Tests use mocks, not actual contract calls
2. **UI Rendering:** Component rendering not tested (would require React Testing Library setup)
3. **Network Latency:** Real-world network delays not simulated
4. **Gas Price Fluctuations:** Static gas estimates used
5. **Wallet Integration:** Actual wallet connections not tested

### Recommended Additional Testing
1. **Manual Testing:** Test with real wallet on Base Sepolia testnet
2. **E2E Tests:** Add Playwright/Cypress tests for full user flows
3. **Performance Tests:** Measure gas costs with real transactions
4. **Load Tests:** Test with many participants (10+)
5. **Security Audit:** Professional audit of smart contract

## Test Maintenance

### When to Update Tests

**Add new tests when:**
- Adding new escrow features
- Fixing bugs (add regression test)
- Changing data structures
- Adding new error cases

**Update existing tests when:**
- Changing function signatures
- Modifying error messages
- Updating validation logic
- Changing data formats

### Test Stability

**Current Status:** ✅ Stable
- No flaky tests
- All tests pass consistently
- Fast execution time
- No external dependencies

## Continuous Integration

### CI/CD Integration
Tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Tests
  run: npm test
  
- name: Check Coverage
  run: npm run test:coverage
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
Recommended pre-commit hook:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Tests failed. Commit aborted."
  exit 1
fi
```

## Conclusion

The integration test suite for the escrow feature is comprehensive, well-structured, and provides high confidence in the implementation. All 71 tests pass successfully, covering:

- ✅ Bill creation with escrow
