# Error Handling Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive error handling for the smart contract escrow integration, covering wallet connection, network validation, contract errors, and loading states.

## Task 7.1: Wallet and Network Error Handling ✅

### Files Created/Modified:
- **Created**: `src/lib/utils/escrowErrors.ts`
- **Modified**: `src/features/payment/hooks/useEscrow.ts`
- **Modified**: `src/features/payment/components/EscrowPaymentButton.tsx`

### Features Implemented:

#### 1. Error Parsing Utility (`escrowErrors.ts`)
- `parseContractError()`: Parses contract revert errors into user-friendly messages
- `validateWalletConnection()`: Checks if wallet is connected
- `validateNetwork()`: Validates user is on correct network
- `validateSufficientBalance()`: Checks if user has enough balance

#### 2. Enhanced useEscrow Hook
- Added `useSwitchChain` for automatic network switching
- Added `useBalance` for balance checking
- Integrated validation functions before transactions
- Automatic network switch prompt when on wrong network
- Returns structured error objects with title, message, and action

#### 3. Enhanced EscrowPaymentButton
- Shows wallet connection warning when not connected
- Shows network warning with switch prompt when on wrong network
- Displays structured error messages with title, message, and action
- Separate states for wallet confirmation vs transaction pending
- Clear visual distinction between different states

### Error Types Handled:
- ✅ Wallet not connected
- ✅ Wrong network (with auto-switch)
- ✅ Insufficient funds for gas
- ✅ Transaction rejection by user
- ✅ Network errors and timeouts

## Task 7.2: Contract Error Handling ✅

### Features Implemented:

#### Contract-Specific Error Parsing
The `parseContractError()` function handles all contract revert reasons:

1. **BillExists**: Bill already created in escrow
2. **AlreadyPaid**: Participant already paid their share
3. **NotParticipant**: User not listed as participant
4. **IncorrectAmount**: Payment amount doesn't match share (shows expected vs actual)
5. **BillNotFound**: Bill doesn't exist in contract

#### Error Display
- Structured error objects with:
  - `title`: Short error title
  - `message`: Detailed explanation
  - `action`: Suggested next steps
- Displayed in red alert boxes with clear formatting
- Errors shown inline in payment components

#### Integration Points
- **EscrowPaymentButton**: Shows contract errors during payment
- **Home page (page.tsx)**: Shows errors during bill creation
- Graceful fallback to direct payment if escrow creation fails

### Error Messages Examples:
```
Title: "Bill Already Exists"
Message: "This bill has already been created in the escrow contract."
Action: "Please use a different bill or proceed with direct payment."

Title: "Incorrect Payment Amount"
Message: "Expected 1000000000000000 wei but received 2000000000000000 wei."
Action: "Please pay the exact amount specified."
```

## Task 7.3: Loading and Pending States ✅

### Files Created/Modified:
- **Created**: `src/components/LoadingSkeleton.tsx`
- **Created**: `src/components/TransactionPending.tsx`
- **Modified**: `src/features/payment/hooks/useEscrow.ts`
- **Modified**: `src/features/payment/components/EscrowPaymentButton.tsx`
- **Modified**: `src/app/page.tsx`

### Features Implemented:

#### 1. Loading Skeleton Components
Created reusable loading components:
- `LoadingSkeleton`: Generic skeleton for text/content
- `LoadingCard`: Card-style skeleton
- `LoadingSpinner`: Animated spinner in 3 sizes (sm, md, lg)

#### 2. Transaction State Components
- `TransactionPending`: Shows pending transaction with:
  - Loading spinner
  - Elapsed time counter
  - Explorer link
  - Timeout warning after 60 seconds
- `TransactionConfirming`: Shows wallet confirmation prompt

#### 3. Enhanced Transaction States

**In useEscrow Hook:**
- Tracks transaction start time
- Monitors elapsed time
- Shows slow transaction warning after 60 seconds
- Resets state on completion

**In EscrowPaymentButton:**
- Separate states for:
  - Wallet confirmation (purple theme)
  - Transaction pending (blue theme)
  - Network congestion warning (yellow theme)
- Shows explorer link during pending state
- Displays slow transaction warning after 60s

**In Home Page (Bill Creation):**
- Shows "Creating bill..." during local creation
- Shows "Confirm transaction in wallet" during wallet approval
- Shows "Creating escrow bill..." during blockchain confirmation
- All states have appropriate loading spinners

#### 4. EscrowStatusDisplay
Already had loading skeleton implementation:
- Animated skeleton while loading contract data
- Warning message when status unavailable
- Proper loading states for all data fetches

### Loading State Flow:
1. **Initial**: Button shows "Pay X USD via Escrow"
2. **Wallet Confirmation**: Purple box with "Confirm in wallet..."
3. **Transaction Pending**: Blue box with spinner and explorer link
4. **Slow Warning** (after 60s): Yellow warning about network congestion
5. **Success**: Green box with "Payment Successful!" and explorer link

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Test payment without wallet connected
- [ ] Test payment on wrong network (should prompt to switch)
- [ ] Test transaction rejection in wallet
- [ ] Test with insufficient balance
- [ ] Test duplicate bill creation (BillExists error)
- [ ] Test duplicate payment (AlreadyPaid error)
- [ ] Test payment from non-participant
- [ ] Test payment with wrong amount
- [ ] Verify loading states during bill creation
- [ ] Verify loading states during payment
- [ ] Wait 60+ seconds to see slow transaction warning
- [ ] Test network congestion scenarios

### Error Scenarios to Test:
1. Disconnect wallet mid-transaction
2. Switch network mid-transaction
3. Reject transaction in wallet
4. Send transaction with low gas
5. Try to pay already-paid bill
6. Try to create duplicate escrow bill

## Code Quality

### Type Safety:
- All error types properly typed with `EscrowError` interface
- Proper TypeScript types throughout
- No `any` types used

### User Experience:
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Visual distinction between error types (colors, icons)
- Loading states prevent confusion
- Timeout warnings manage expectations
- Explorer links for transaction verification

### Performance:
- Minimal re-renders with proper state management
- Efficient error parsing
- Cleanup of timers and intervals
- No memory leaks

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Gas Estimation**: Show estimated gas costs before transactions
2. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed transactions
3. **Error Analytics**: Track error frequency for monitoring
4. **Offline Detection**: Detect and warn about offline state
5. **Transaction History**: Store and display past errors
6. **Custom Error Codes**: Map contract errors to help articles
7. **Multi-language**: Translate error messages
8. **Error Recovery**: Automated recovery flows for common errors
