## Using Escrow Protection (Optional)

Escrow provides trustless bill settlement through smart contracts:

### Enable Escrow

1. **Deploy Contract** (one-time setup)
   ```bash
   # See contracts/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions
   cd contracts
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Configure Frontend**
   - Contract address is automatically added to `.env.local`
   - Restart dev server to load new config

3. **Create Escrow Bill**
   - Toggle "Use Escrow Protection" when creating bill
   - Confirm transaction to create escrow on-chain
   - Share bill link with participants

4. **Participants Pay**
   - Each participant clicks "Pay via Escrow"
   - Funds are locked in contract
   - Payment status updates in real-time

5. **Automatic Settlement**
   - When all participants pay, contract automatically transfers funds to creator
   - No additional action needed
   - View settlement transaction on BaseScan

### Benefits of Escrow

- âœ… **Trustless**: No need to trust the bill creator
- âœ… **Transparent**: All payments visible on-chain
- âœ… **Automatic**: Settlement happens instantly when complete
- âœ… **Secure**: Funds locked until everyone pays

### When to Use Escrow

**Use Escrow For:**
- Large bills with unfamiliar participants
- Group events with many people
- When trust is a concern
- When you want on-chain proof

**Use Direct Payment For:**
- Small bills with friends
- Quick splits with trusted people
- When minimizing gas costs is priority
